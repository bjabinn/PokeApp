# PokeApp

# Setup
There is no specific stuff to setup. Just make sure you have everything on Xamarin running. If it doesn't build out-of-the-box try to clean and rebuild.

Also check the Constants.cs in the shared code to replace the IP address in there with your own! And of course you have to have the accompanying backend running which you can find [here](https://github.com/faniereynders/PokeApp).
